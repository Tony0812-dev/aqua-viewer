# AquaViewer
TLDR: this fork will not be updated.

You can still read old readme [here](README_project.md).

## Important notice
It was a great opportunity for hardening my skills and learning how production system works, but recently I lost my motivation toward maintaining this code. I thought it will be better to make official statement now for the good.

I'd like to thank everyone for supporting my development and use their time for trying this little project.

## What will happen after this?
Server (that you are running) will still function and its source code will preserved here even after this notice. However, issues and pull requests will not be closed and resolved. Future version of (supported) game might not work.

## Will this impact other Aqua forks or "online Aqua"?
No.

## What are my other options?
I'd like to recommend using [ARTEMiS](https://gitea.tendokyu.moe/Hay1tsme/artemis). It's more robust and easily expandable using power of Python language. Also, maintainers are active and nice ;)

### Can I migrate to ARTEMiS?
There is [AQUA-to-ARTEMiS](https://gitea.tendokyu.moe/Dniel97/AQUA-to-ARTEMiS) project. However, I can't test if it still works with latest version.
